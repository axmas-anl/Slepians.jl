# Slepians.jl



# Installation

Slepians.jl is unregistered and relies on unregistered packages. To avoid difficulties in which Julia does not know the relevant URLS, I have created a registry bbkt-reg.jl which will tell your installation where to find this package and its dependencies. Begin with adding the registry using 

```
pkg> registry add https://github.com/lootie/bbkt-reg.jl
```

then one can simply add the Slepians.jl package as

```
pkg> add Slepians
```
