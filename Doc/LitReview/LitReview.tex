\title{Literature Review: Coherence with Gaps}

\section{Basic Papers}

  \subsection{Spectrum Estimation and Harmonic Analysis}

  The relevant material here is in \cite[\S XIV]{t82}. 

  When the lines and the background noise have commensurate magnitude: ``cases commonly occur where
  both the background noise process and the line components are independently coherent, but, because
  their cross-spectra have different phases, their sum appears incoherent"

  \subsection{Coherence and Time Delay Estimation}

  Main points:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Compares tapering (Blackman-Tukey), WOSA, and lag-window smoothing (Carter and Nuttall). 
  \item Expressions for bias and variance of MSC estimates are given in Table 1, 2. 
  \item Bias due to rapidly changing phase 
      `` Koopmans \cite{koopmans} notes that if the phase angle of the cross power spectrum is a
  rapidly varying function of frequency at the frequency that the coherence is to be estimated, the
  estimated coherence (in particular, MSC) can be biased downward to such an extent that a strong
  coherence is masked"
    
    Rapidly changing phase may be due to a misalignment or lag of D time units and duration T.
  Carter calculates the bias in this case. For example, if 1 D/T= 0.25, the expected value of the
  estimated MSC is about one-half of its true value.

  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{note}
  \cite{carter87} is a review paper on coherence estimation cited by \cite{TC91} which has \emph{many} citations. 
  It references \cite{lee83} which is the first jackknifing of coherency. 
  \end{note}

  \subsection{Time Series: Theory and Methods}
  Brockwell and Davis's 1991 book (the only e-resource for this seems to be google
books
\url{https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ZW_ThhYQiXIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=time+series+theory+and+methods+1991&ots=g-hXlUCNh9&sig=T6FawataQosk_pIG_11GM9ikNsQ#v=onepage&q=time%20series%20theory%20and%20methods%201991&f=false})
has a discussion of coherence estimation (p 438) with lagged window estimators. The
weight function used is (p 447)
